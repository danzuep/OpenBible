# Open Bible

This open-source, cross platform [Bible](https://github.com/danzuep/OpenBible) is very much still a work in progress, but the Android install APK can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/danzuep/OpenBible/releases/latest) and the website can be viewed [here](https://danzuep.github.io/OpenBible/).

The main point of difference I'm aiming for in both the Android/iOS apps and on the website is to be able to [transcribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization) any language into English (e.g. [Jyutping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyutping) for Cantonese, [Furigana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana) for Japanese). I'll start the implementation of that when the website is more user-friendly, the app is already good enough to read through any public domain bible in any language on your phone.

## Mobile App

C# .NET MAUI app for Android/iOS/PC.

## Website
