[["c","12"],["p",""],["v","1"],["add","It seems that"],[""," I must go on boasting "],["add","about myself"],["",". Although "],["add","I do"],[""," not "],["add","think that my telling you about"],[""," this will help "],["add","you to accept me as Christ’s representative to you"],["",", I "],["add","will say this anyway"],["",".

"],["v","2"],["","The man that I will tell you about is one "],["add","who believes"],[""," in Christ.
