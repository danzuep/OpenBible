    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="GEN 1:1"/>Long, long ago God created the heavens and the earth. <verse eid="GEN 1:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="GEN 1:2"/>When he began to create the earth, it was shapeless and completely desolate/chaotic. Darkness covered the deep water that surrounded the earth. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the water. <verse eid="GEN 1:2"/><verse number="3" style="v" sid="GEN 1:3"/>God said, “I want light to shine!” And light shone. <verse eid="GEN 1:3"/><verse number="4" style="v" sid="GEN 1:4"/>God was pleased with the light. Then he made the light to shine in some places, and in other places there was still darkness. <verse eid="GEN 1:4"/><verse number="5" style="v" sid="GEN 1:5"/>He gave to the light the name ‘day’, and he gave to the darkness the name ‘night’. After that, there was an evening which was followed by a morning. He called that whole period of time ‘the first day’. <verse eid="GEN 1:5"/><verse number="6" style="v" sid="GEN 1:6"/>Then God said, “I command that there be an empty space like a huge dome to separate the water that is above it from the water on the earth that is below it!” <verse eid="GEN 1:6"/><verse number="7" style="v" sid="GEN 1:7"/>And that is what happened. God gave to the space the name ‘sky’. <verse eid="GEN 1:7"/><verse number="8" style="v" sid="GEN 1:8"/>Then there was another evening, which was followed by another morning. He called that period of time ‘the second day’.<verse eid="GEN 1:8"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" sid="GEN 1:9"/>Then God said, “I want the water that is below the sky to come together, and dry ground to appear and rise above the water.” And that is what happened. <verse eid="GEN 1:9"/><verse number="10" style="v" sid="GEN 1:10"/>God gave to the ground the name ‘earth’, and he gave to the water that came together the name ‘oceans’. God was pleased with the earth and the oceans. <verse eid="GEN 1:10"/><verse number="11" style="v" sid="GEN 1:11"/>Then God said, “I want the earth to produce plants, including plants that will produce seeds and trees that will produce fruit. Each kind of tree will bear its own kind of fruit.” <verse eid="GEN 1:11"/><verse number="12" style="v" sid="GEN 1:12"/>Then plants grew on the earth; each kind of plant began to produce its own kind of seed. <verse eid="GEN 1:12"/><verse number="13" style="v" sid="GEN 1:13"/>Then there was another evening which was followed by another morning. God called that period of time ‘the third day’.<verse eid="GEN 1:13"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" sid="GEN 1:14"/>Then God said, “I want a sun, a moon, and many stars to shine in the sky. The sun will shine in the daytime and the moon and stars will shine during the nighttime. By the changes in their appearance they will indicate the various seasons (OR, the times for special celebrations), and will enable people to know when days and years begin. <verse eid="GEN 1:14"/><verse number="15" style="v" sid="GEN 1:15"/>I want them also to be like lights in the sky that will shine on the earth.” And that is what happened. <verse eid="GEN 1:15"/><verse number="16" style="v" sid="GEN 1:16"/>God made two of them that were like big lights. The bigger one, the sun, shines during the day and the smaller one, the moon, shines during the night. He also made the stars. <verse eid="GEN 1:16"/><verse number="17" style="v" sid="GEN 1:17"/>God set all of them in the sky to shine on the earth, <verse eid="GEN 1:17"/><verse number="18" style="v" sid="GEN 1:18"/>to rule the day and the night, and to separate the light of the daytime from the darkness of the nighttime. God was pleased with these things he had made. <verse eid="GEN 1:18"/><verse number="19" style="v" sid="GEN 1:19"/>Then there was another evening which was followed by another morning. He called that period of time ‘the fourth day’. <verse eid="GEN 1:19"/><verse number="20" style="v" sid="GEN 1:20"/>Then God said, “I want many creatures to live in all the oceans, and I also want birds to fly in the sky above the earth.” <verse eid="GEN 1:20"/><verse number="21" style="v" sid="GEN 1:21"/>So God created huge sea creatures and every other kind of creature that moves in the water, and caused them to live in all the oceans. He also created many kinds of birds. God was pleased with all those creatures. <verse eid="GEN 1:21"/><verse number="22" style="v" sid="GEN 1:22"/>God blessed them. He said, “Produce offspring and become very numerous. I want the creatures in the water to live in all the oceans, and birds also to become very numerous.” And that is what happened. <verse eid="GEN 1:22"/><verse number="23" style="v" sid="GEN 1:23"/>Then there was another evening that was followed by another morning. He called that period of time ‘the fifth day’. <verse eid="GEN 1:23"/><verse number="24" style="v" sid="GEN 1:24"/>Then God said, “I want various kinds of creatures to appear on the earth. There will be many kinds of ◄livestock/domestic animals►, creatures that scurry across the ground, and large wild animals.” And that is what happened. <verse eid="GEN 1:24"/><verse number="25" style="v" sid="GEN 1:25"/>God made all kinds of wild animals and ◄livestock/domestic animals► and all kinds of creatures that scurry across the ground. God was pleased with all these creatures.<verse eid="GEN 1:25"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" sid="GEN 1:26"/>Then God said, “Now we will make human beings that will be like us in many ways.

He made them to be like himself. He created some to be male and some to be female. <verse eid="GEN 1:27"/><verse number="28" style="v" sid="GEN 1:28"/>God blessed them, saying, “Produce many children, who will live all over the earth and rule over it. I want them to rule over the fish and the birds and over all creatures that scurry across the ground.” <verse eid="GEN 1:28"/><verse number="29" style="v" sid="GEN 1:29"/>God said to the humans, “Listen! I have given you all the plants that produce seeds, all over the earth, and all the trees that have seeds in their fruit. All these things are for you to eat. <verse eid="GEN 1:29"/><verse number="30" style="v" sid="GEN 1:30"/>I have given all the green plants to all the wild animals and to the birds and to all the creatures that scurry across the ground, to everything that breathes, for them to eat.” And that is what happened. <verse eid="GEN 1:30"/><verse number="31" style="v" sid="GEN 1:31"/>God was pleased with everything that he had made. Truly, it was all very good. Then there was another evening, that was followed by another morning. He called that period of time ‘the sixth day’.<verse eid="GEN 1:31"/></para>

He separated them and told his sons to take care of them. <verse eid="GEN 30:35"/><verse number="36" style="v" sid="GEN 30:36"/>Then he took these flocks and walked a distance of three days, in order that he could be that far from Jacob.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="37" style="v" sid="GEN 30:37"/>Then Jacob cut some branches of ◄poplar, almond, and plane trees/three kinds of trees that had white wood►. He peeled strips of bark from the branches, so that where the bark had been peeled off, the branches were light in color. <verse eid="GEN 30:37"/><verse number="38" style="v" sid="GEN 30:38"/>Then he placed the peeled branches in the troughs where they put the water for the animals to drink, so that the branches would be in front of the flocks when they came to drink. <verse eid="GEN 30:38"/><verse number="39" style="v" sid="GEN 30:39"/>The animals also mated in front of the branches, and eventually they gave birth to animals that were speckled, or to animals that were spotted, or to animals that had black and white stripes on them. <verse eid="GEN 30:39"/><verse number="40" style="v" sid="GEN 30:40"/>Furthermore, Jacob separated the female sheep in his flock from the other sheep and goats in Laban’s flock. And when his female sheep mated, he made them look toward the animals that belonged to Laban that had black and white stripes on them, and the dark-colored animals. He did that so that the female sheep would give birth to animals that were striped or dark-colored. By doing that, he made bigger flocks for himself, and he kept them separate from Laban’s flocks. <verse eid="GEN 30:40"/><verse number="41" style="v" sid="GEN 30:41"/>In addition, whenever the stronger female sheep were ready to mate, Jacob put some of those peeled branches in the troughs in front of them, so that they would mate in front of the branches. <verse eid="GEN 30:41"/><verse number="42" style="v" sid="GEN 30:42"/>But when weak animals were ready to mate, he did not put the branches in their troughs. So the weak ones became part of Laban’s flock, and the strong ones became part of Jacob’s flock. <verse eid="GEN 30:42"/><verse number="43" style="v" sid="GEN 30:43"/>As a result, Jacob became very rich. He owned many large flocks of sheep and goats, and many male and female slaves, and many camels and donkeys.<verse eid="GEN 30:43"/></para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="GEN 50:1"/>Joseph leaned close to his father’s face and cried over him and kissed him. <verse eid="GEN 50:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="GEN 50:2"/>Joseph commanded his servants who were morticians to ◄embalm his father’s body/put spices on his father’s body► to ◄preserve it/keep it from decaying►, and then wrap it with strips of cloth. <verse eid="GEN 50:2"/><verse number="3" style="v" sid="GEN 50:3"/>So the morticians did that. It took 40 days to embalm Jacob’s body, because that is the amount of time that was always required for them to embalm a body. And the people of Egypt mourned for 70 days because of Jacob’s death. <verse eid="GEN 50:3"/><verse number="4" style="v" sid="GEN 50:4"/>When the time of mourning was finished, Joseph said to the king’s officials, “If you are pleased with me, please take this message to the king: <verse eid="GEN 50:4"/><verse number="5" style="v" sid="GEN 50:5"/>‘When my father was about to die, he told me to solemnly promise that I would bury his body in Canaan, in the tomb that he himself had prepared.
